Numerical Methods to describe anomalous, Non-Fickian, diffusion with fractional differential equations. Based on the paper "Fast Finite Volume Methods for Space-Fractional Diffusion Equations"(https://www.aimsciences.org/journals/displayArticlesnew.jsp?paperID=11120). The intent is to replicate the proposed algorithm to model anomolous diffusion, and upon the creation a successful model, a Deep Learning model will be constructed. The entire aim of this paper, and the consequential deep learning model, is to show a efficable method that is computationally efficient. This will be a 6 month-1 year long project.
